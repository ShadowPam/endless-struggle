# Endless Struggle

An endless web-based roguelike where the player is a hunter battling monsters one by one in a turn based environment. After each successful battle the player will get to pick between 3 options for stat upgrades, items or relics that modify the following battles. The player will be scored and receive a high score depending on how many monsters they killed. The difficulty will increase as the number of battles go up. Every monster will on their turn present a joke upon battle start that will reduce the playerâ€™s hitpoints. During battle the monster's current damage and health will be adjusted by the struggle meter as well as the amount of previous battles finished. The struggle meter will make the jokes do more damage and create a blur effect on the screen to give the player feedback on how much struggle they are in. During battle the struggle meter goes up by how many turns it takes the player to successfully slay the monster. After a successful battle the struggle meter will go down by a set amount(able to be increased through upgrades).
